## Playing 2048 Using Deep Reinforcement Learning
<p>After reading a book on AlphaGo, I decided to make an implementation of MCTS + Deep Reinforcement Learning for 2048.
This Project uses a DDQN with a PER to estimate Q(s,a) for a given game state and action.
Q(s,a) is combined with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to produce a better estimate of the most optimal move in the current situation.</p>

## Todo
- Add Adaptive search depth for MCTS (Some states have fewer empty squares or more high value tiles, expand the search depth for these states
- Improved action selection for selection step in MCTS. (Currently MCTS selects the action randomly when performing rollouts.
Instead of this, we can use the Q(s,a) values generated by the dqn to produce probabilities for each move with better moves being selected more often.)
